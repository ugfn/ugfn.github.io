  <h1>The new UGFN</h1>
  <h3>This is the new UGFN, which is going to replace the previous UGFN. This version is almost completely different from the old UGFN. Firstly, the games themselves are built into the website, meaning the website itself needs to be blocked in order to block the games. Second, the game links are dynamically made, so the game links aren't hard coded. This means adding new games won't be anywhere near as repetitive as the old UGFN. Enjoy.</h3>
